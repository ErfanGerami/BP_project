<h4>Hi welcome to my  Basic Programming project</h4>
this code is a game created to measure and raise your typing skils.but winning fairly is so hard !only if there was a cheat code hidden inside it...

<h2>what does the code do?</h2>
I will upload the doc as well but there are a lot of changes that I made .You can see all of them here <a href=""></a>
So first we have the welcome page then You should Register as a new user or sign in if you've already done signing in.
In the Next page you see 3 previous games.and you can choose to play them again from where you where.And there are also an option which draws youu previouse games
chart.
also you have all three options for right or left handed game too(hard,medium,easy)
